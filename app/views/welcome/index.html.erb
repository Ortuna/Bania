        <h3 class="question">
          1. Do I need to signup or make an account? Is there software
          to install?
        </h3>

        <p class="answer">
          Nope. Bania.io works just by sending emails.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3 class="question">
          1. How often do I need to send an email to Bania.io?
        </h3>

        <p class="answer">
          If your goal is to walk every day, then every time you accomplish your 
          goal, you send an email to walkeveryday@bania.io.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3 class="question">
          3. Is Bania.io secure? Can someone else edit or see my report?
        </h3>

        <p class="answer">
          Bania.io is inherently secure because it uses your email address as your unique identifier. Only someone using your email address through your email client (yahoo mail, gmail, hotmail, etc...) can send and receive emails from Bania.io. 

          This means that Bania .io is just as secure as your email account. So long as your email stays safe, your Bania.io reports are safe. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3 class="question">
          4. Do I need to make unique addresses for each report? What if someone already has walkeveryday@bania.io?
        </h3>

        <p class="answer">
          The addresses only need to be unique to you. You can still use walkeveryday@bania.io even if a million people are already using it. This is because Bania.io sees every user email address as unique and special - just like you!

      <div class="item">
        <h3 class="question">
          5. Is this really free?
        </h3>

        <p class="answer">
          Yep! Bania.io is a side project and is totally automated right now, so it costs very little to run.
